# About Project

[Project Proposal (pdf)](documents\cvt_blueprint.pdf)

## What is it?
* A community-organized, simple tablet-based communication system that allows patients to communicate without in-person contact.
* It puts virtual communication tools directly into the hands of front line nurses who are fighting COVID-19.
* [1min Video Demonstration](https://youtu.be/6ZVUICEj1T8)

## Why do Health Care Workers need it?
* Eases HCW Stress and increases safety
* Allows HCW to communicate more frequently with patients.
* Reduced in-person contact reduces spread of the virus.
* Reduces need for isolation gear, which is in short supply and needs to be prioritized for urgent cases.

## Why do patients need it?
* Eases patient stress and feelings of isolation.
* Empowers patients to reach out to nurses, without worry of  'wasting supplies‚Äù - yes right patients are worried about this!
* Enables patients to connect with families while hospitalized
* Visitation is not permitted, no matter what - let that sink in.

## Why it needs you?
* The traditional methods of new tool large scale integration do not work during a pandemic.
* Small teams can respond quickly and efficiently in their local community.
* Cases are doubling rapidly and health care workers need support tools urgently.

## What does it take?
* Groups of 'package creators' to reach into their communities and acquire and set-up tablets.
* 8-12 hrs of your time over 3 days (roughly) to create a package.
