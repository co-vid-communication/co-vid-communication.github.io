## Privacy / Disclaimer Information
1. We ("health care workers" or "HCW") are using Signal to communicate with patients on their medical issues.
2. Before adding a patient to a messaging list authenticate them ie check that you have the right person.  For example with video calling visually show your ID to the patient;have the patient show you their wristband.
3. That may be difficult to do if you're sending pictures or a message; if the patient doesn't have their device or if you don't know if the patient's device is secure.  If that is the case then it's probably best to call a trusted third party close to the patient (eg clerk, medical assistant etc).  Send data to that trusted third party.  Confirm they have it.  Then have them delete it after
4. Signal has an option to have messages disappear after a certain time (5 seconds to 1 hour).  Use your discretion and check with the patient but we're going to tentatively recommend that between 30 minutes to 1 hour disappear on all conversations is idea.
5. Obviously, check that you have the right phone number.  Be disciplined in authentication.
