## Privacy / Disclaimer Information
1. If you are getting a loaner device check that you delete all messages before giving it back to us
2. If you are using a loaner device just for Signal to your designated HCW then our security protocols (authentication, disappearing messages) should be sufficient to safeguard the security of your personal information.  However if you us the loaner device to log onto other services or use other apps (Instagram, Facebook, webmail etc) you are responsible for your own security!
3. The Signal app has a "fake" phone number associated with the loaner device.  It isn't your personal number.   Do NOT make "normal" phone calls using the Signal App.   If you need to make a phone call to someone ask for assistance.    If you make "normal" calls to someone else using the Signal app then that person may have the wrong number for you.  When they try to call you back instead of that person contacting you they may get another patient to whom the loaner device was assigned.     
4. If you are using a loaner device DO NOT enter any personal data on any app or service other than Signal i.e. do not put phone number, email address, credit card info into the loaner device.  If you do so then you risk compromising your privacy and you also risk the security of the loaner device.  If you disregard this direction and still insist on putting your personal data on the loaner device then you bear all risk for doing so.   Wipe all such information from the loaner device before returning it to us. 
5. If you lose the loaner device TELL US IMMEDIATELY.  We will attempt to disable your Signal account so that messages sent to you are deleted.
