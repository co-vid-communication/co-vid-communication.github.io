## Championing
If you are looking at this solution from another area / healthcare facility, feel free to start a local effort using the materials found here as a seed packet.
The team is discussing a method of providing feedback to improve methods and information. 

## Privacy / Disclaimer Information
1. We ("health care workers" or "HCW") are using Signal to communicate with patients on their medical issues.
2. Before adding a patient to a messaging list authenticate them ie check that you have the right person.  For example with video calling visually show your ID to the patient; have the patient show you their wristband.
3. That may be difficult to do if you're sending pictures or a message; if the patient doesn't have their device or if you don't know if the patient's device is secure.  If that is the case then it's probably best to call a trusted third party close to the patient (eg clerk, medical assistant etc).  Send data to that trusted third party.  Confirm they have it.  Then have them delete it after
4. Signal has an option to have messages disappear after a certain time (5 seconds to 1 hour).  Use your discretion and check with the patient but we're going to tentatively recommend that between 30 minutes to 1 hour disappear on all conversations is idea.
5. Obviously, check that you have the right phone number.  Be disciplined in authentication.


## System Risks & Benefits:
1. Patients want to communicate with the healthcare team using voice, text & video.
2. The Signal app transmits encrypted data safely between devices (signal.org).
3. The devices are NOT secure, they might not have passwords and could be stolen or used by someone other than the healthcare team.
4. There is some risk that health information shared on this device may be intercepted or unintentionally disclosed.

## Protect Yourself:
1. Confirm you are communicating with the right person (show ID on video, donâ€™t text sensitive information).
2. Set messages to disappear after 30 minutes.
3. Only use the Signal App on this device
4. Donâ€™t enter personal information into this device (donâ€™t log into email, google, enter your credit card etc.).

## Understand the â€˜Phone Numberâ€™:
1. This device has a â€˜fakeâ€™ phone number that is only used by the Signal app.
2. This device can ONLY communicate with other Signal app users (it canâ€™t make normal phone calls or be called by normal phones).
3. Please donâ€™t communicate with Signal users except the healthcare team. (If you do, you MUST tell them when you give the device back, so they do not call you in the future).
4. If you lose the device, notify the team immediately and the Signal number will be deactivated.

## Signal disclaimer/how to use Signal
