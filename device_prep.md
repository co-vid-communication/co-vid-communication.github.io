# Co:Vid Device Prepping Volunteer Guide

## Overview

Your goal as a Device Prepping Volunteer is to take a donated device, wipe, install and test Single ready for use inside a Hospital.

## Procedure

### Step 1 - Check device is supported
- In the settings, check the device’s Android version. If it’s under 4.4, we cannot use it as it is. So stop here and move on to another device.
- An update may be available for this device but you should only spend time looking for and applying an update if there are no other devices to process.
- If working through a batch, setting up newer models first is more likely to go smoother; older models may require extra steps or googling.

### Step 2 - Charge device
- Ensure the device has significant charge, suggest > 50%, and leave connected for the rest of the process if possible.

### Step 3 - Check for SIM card
- If the device has a removable SIM card, turn off the device and remove it. 
- Even if deactivated, the donor’s personal cell phone number is stored on this and could be viewed by anyone checking the ‘About Phone’ section.

### Step 4 - Factory reset the device
- Skip this step if setting up a brand new out of the box device.
- This is only to remove information left on the device by the previous owner.
- The steps might be different for each device, google “Factory reset” and the device make and model.

### Step 5 - Onboard the device
- Go through the device onboarding steps.
- When prompted, do not enter real names or emails.
- “Patient Phone” is a good name to use.
- Skip any options to sign up for or into google accounts.
- Skip any options to recover data or port from another device.
- You should be prompted to connect to a wifi network as part of this which you must do.
- At the end of this step, you should be on the device's desktop.

### Step 6 - Airplane + WiFi
- In the drag-down menu, turn on Airplane mode to disable bluetooth and cell service.
- Then, re-enable WiFi by tapping the icon. This will extend battery life and reduce background processes on the device.
### Step 7 - Install Signal directly from Signal’s website
- Go to this URL on the device’s web browser. https://signal.org/android/apk/
- Scroll down to the “Danger zone” and click download.
- Open the downloaded file, you will be prevented from installing it, but should be given a button to get quick access to the settings to allow a one time installation of an untrusted app.

### Step 8 - Register a number
- Open Signal and enter one of the numbers supplied to you.
- Enter the corresponding SMS code on the next screen.
- Again, do not use a real name. Enter “Patient” as first name.
- If you are prompted to set a pin, choose 1111.
- ⚠️Be very careful not to reuse a number, you will end up disabling the first device which may already be in the hospital.

### Step 9 - Do a test
- Using a test device, send some messages and do a test video call between it and the newly set up unit.
- During messaging, do not add the devices as contacts to each other, just select the “share profile” option. Delete the conversations afterwards.
