## Why do Health Care Workers need it?
* Eases HCW Stress and increases safety
* Allows HCW to communicate more frequently with patients.
* Reduced in-person contact reduces spread of the virus.
* Protective gear is in short supply and needs to be prioritized for urgent cases.

## Why do patients need it?
* Eases patient stress and feelings of isolation.
* Empowers patients to reach out to nurses, without worry of  'wasting supplies‚Äù - yes right patients are worried about this!
* Enables patients to connect with families while hospitalized
* Visitation is not permitted, no matter what - let that sink in.

* Small teams can respond quickly and efficiently in their local community.
* Cases are doubling rapidly and health care workers need support tools urgently.

## What does it take?
* Groups of 'package creators' to reach into their communities and acquire and set-up tablets.
* 8-12 hrs of your time over 3 days (roughly) to create a package.

# Secure 1-1 video communication tools for Healthcare Workers

By using free, secure open-source software (signal.org) and consumer grade electronics the team can set up a system with encryption between patient and health care worker. This allows for secure virtual video, voice and text within the hospital setting without significant disruption to the existing workflows used to care for patients. 

It also facilitates health care workers on home isolation to continue to connect with patients remotely and significantly reduces PPE consumption.
