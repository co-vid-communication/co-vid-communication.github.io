# Secure 1-1 video communication tools for Healthcare Workers

By using free, secure open-source software (signal.org) and consumer grade electronics the team can set up a system with encryption between patient and health care worker.  This allows for secure virtual video, voice and text within the hospital setting without significant disruption to the existing workflows used to care for patients. 

It also facilitates health care workers on home isolation to continue to connect with patients remotely and significantly reduces PPE consumption.
