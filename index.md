# Secure video communication tools for Healthcare Workers

By using free, secure open-source software (signal.org) and spare or donated devices anyone can set up a care package for healthcare workers fighting on the front line against COVID-19. 

This allows for secure virtual video, voice and text within the hospital setting without significant disruption to the existing workflows used to care for patients. 

It also facilitates health care workers on home isolation to continue to connect with patients remotely and significantly reduces PPE consumption.
